										<p>The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a "world-class" supercar. Many years of development and prototyping led to the company's first street-legal production car delivery in 2002.

										<h3>Koenigsegg Regera Features</h3>
										<p>Christian von Koenigsegg believes that a good design of the day-time running lights (DRL) on a vehicle gives it character, and developed a DRL system that is supposed to resemble a constellation with the carbon-fiber background resembling the night sky.
										Koenigsegg claims that the Regera is the first "fully-robotized" car. The vehicle features hydraulic pumps and accumulators to control the active front and rear wings, as well as active chassis control and lifting. Hydraulic lifters were added to the already existing pumps and accumulators to allow for all body panels on the vehicle to be remotely operated.</p>
